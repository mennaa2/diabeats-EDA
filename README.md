Diabetes EDA
Diabetes EDA
In this project, I worked on performing a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a medical dataset related to diabetes. The goal was to deeply understand how different health measurements — like Glucose, BMI, Age, Insulin — impact the diabetes outcome.
📌 What I did in the project:
 ✔ Cleaned the dataset and handled outliers using IQR
 ✔ Visualized histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots
 ✔ Explored patterns between glucose levels, BMI distribution, and diabetes outcome
 ✔ Studied class imbalance and how it affects model performance
 ✔ Identified the key features that have the strongest predictive power
📊 Important insights:
Glucose is the strongest differentiator between diabetic and non-diabetic patients
High BMI and age significantly increase diabetes risk
Family history (DPF) shows noticeable impact
Insulin and SkinThickness contain many zeros → require proper preprocessing
Outlier removal improved data consistency and clarity
